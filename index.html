          <h1 class="post-title">On Static Site Generators</h1></a><span class="post-date"> August 29, 2013</span></div>
      <div class="post-body"><p>Static site generators seem to be the current in-vogue project an individual 
can craft in their spare time. All the tools you need to plop one together 
are there, in numerous languages - a markup-&gt;html compiler, a syntax 
highlighter, a simple web server, a file watcher,  and of course myriad 
css and js frameworks, transpilers and minifiers.</p>
<p>And in turn we have a myriad of static site generators. No one thinks the set 
of constrains and flexibilities that anyone else&#39;s implements is quite right 
for their situation, and I think this is a good thing. The more I get to 
experiment with, or cynically judge unworthy!</p>
<p>This is my first post using one now. I have used 
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> before, but the theming and post creation 
process was too involved. That may seem incredulous to anyone that has 
used it, and indeed I still think it&#39;s a great project, but the 
barrier-to-entry of creating a post needs to be practically zero. 
If you wish to change your post&#39;s title, there&#39;s a little messing around 
involved, not good enough! Creating a new theme for it is also a little 
daunting. Not anything impossible, simply more nitpicky than I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>Octopress is based on the awesome <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> though, which 
I have used to help create some great tutorials, so it&#39;s not all bad. Really, 
it&#39;s hard not to be awesome when github will compile and host it for you!</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve been wanting to check out soom of the tools surrounding NodeJS 
so I decided to invent this blog in something from that. <em>My</em> main constraint 
in choosing from the gaggle (or hundreds, between everything availabe from 
Node, Ruby, Python and Go) was something with extracted themes.</p>
<p>What&#39;s so hard about separating content (...the blog/site) from 
presentation (how it looks)? I thought people had learnt this lesson way 
back in the early 2000s when they decided <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> really wasn&#39;t 
the way to go. What&#39;s my idea here? Well, simple - include a theme as a 
git submodule. If I want to change look, there&#39;s no more messing around with 
three or four different folders, trying to figure out what is central to 
a basic look and what gives things pizzazz - just clone a different 
theme&#39;s repository.</p>
<p>I had looked at <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a> recently, just to start 
getting my feet wet with npm and node, but it didn&#39;t have this idea 
baked in. I&#39;ve since come across <a href="http://www.cabinjs.com/">Cabin</a>, which 
comes very close. You can at least <em>choose</em> any theme you&#39;d like, by 
passing it a Github project path, e.g <code>CabinJS/Blok</code> (there&#39;s an option to 
test with local ones as well), and customize thereafter. Cabin is what has 
generated this page so far. It&#39;s still not quite there with truly 
plug-and-play themeability, but it&#39;ll do until I decide to add my own 
contribution to the list of these types of projects, or someone 
steals (...implements) the idea completely first.</p>
<p>In fact the Node Package Manager has become so littered with 
composable tools that Cabin is little more than a 
<a href="http://gruntjs.com">Gruntfile</a> generator (ok, a bit more than that). 
This speaks a little to the advantages of following &quot;The Unix Way&quot; 
(although I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s always necessarily best to follow that 
dogmatically), and what enables. I just wish npm would grab packages a 
little faster for an Australian.</p>
<p>Cabin is composed of its own page generator (making use of 
<a href="http://jade-lang">jade</a> templates), <a href="http://compass-style.org">compass</a> for 
some basic styling, <a href="http://pygments.org">pygments</a> for syntax highlighting, 
and various grunt plugins for moving files around and serving them to your 
browser. Seriously, you need three different scripting languages installed 
to get full use out of this thing! Overhead, shmoverhead, we&#39;ve got laziness 
to enable.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll probably love static site generators best if you like editing a 
pure-text format like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, but 
their other major feature is that there are plenty of options to host them 
for free these days, and they&#39;re pretty much non-hackable. As far as I know.</p>
<p>Is there some ridiculously easy to use static site generator that you know of? 
Or is it way too powerful for its own good? How many options does it have? 
Let me know.</p>
