<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-encrypted-media-20131022/#extensions" title="W3C Encrypted Media Extensions">Encrypted Media Extension Working Draft</a>. The EME draft is widely
talked about as &quot;the DRM standard for HTML5&quot;, but this is not truly what
it&#39;s content covers. I&#39;ll look at what it is, why it&#39;s not a great
idea, and some implications of its approval, were it to be approved.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>It&#39;s possible to tell what&#39;s <em>actually</em> covered by the W3C&#39;s draft by
carefully examining its title; the second word - <em>&quot;media&quot;</em> - is
the key. Your average layman might assume that this refers
to media in the general sense (and its <em>oh-so-natural</em> wont for encryption);
whereas in fact, it refers very specifically to HTML5&#39;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element" title="HTML5 Embedded Content 4.8.10 - Media elements">media elements</a>.
You might know them as <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>. The standard
specifies some funky extensions to their DOM/Javascript API, based around
cryptographic key management. There is almost nothing here about interesting
DRM technology, but there <em>are</em> some warnings that it will introduce
yet another way for advertisers to <a href="http://samy.pl/evercookie/" title="Evercookie">track you</a>. Huzzah.</p>
<h2><a name="so-where-s-the-drm-"class="anchor" href="#so-where-s-the-drm-"><span class="header-link"></span></a>So where&#39;s the DRM?</h2>
<p>Good question. It is all hidden away in a little black box called a CDM, or
Content Decryption Module. Now keep in mind that according to sources like
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/drm-in-html5-is-a-victory-for-the-open-web-not-a-defeat/" title="Ars Technica | DRM in HTML5 is a Victory...">Ars Technica</a>: &quot;[EME] ...will allow the delivery of DRM-protected media
through the browser <strong>without the use of plugins such as Flash or Silverlight</strong>.&quot;
(emphasis mine). Here&#39;s the definition of a CDM from the draft (Emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Content Decryption Module (CDM) is a generic term for <strong>a part of 
or add-on to the user agent</strong> that provides functionality for one or more 
Key Systems. Implementations may or may not separate the implementations 
of CDMs and <strong>may or may not treat them as separate from the user agent</strong>. 
This is transparent to the API and application. 
A user agent may support one or more CDMs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A &quot;user agent&quot; here basically refers to your browser.</p>
<p>Now forgive me for being incredulous, but these things sound <em>an aweful lot
like plugins</em>. And frankly, that&#39;s not at all surprising. You can&#39;t have a
successful DRM system without a closed part. If you want to hide or control
something on a user&#39;s system, you cannot start off with a blank slate - you
need something hidden or obfuscated already there. HTML5 EME can be summarised
as laying out an API of Javascript callbacks for retrieving a key.
Implementation-wise, a key (or license) is pretty much just a bit of JSON.
The following then roughly occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The key is passed into a compatible CDM.</li>
<li>The CDM decrypts your media element&#39;s source.</li>
<li>It is sent for playback - either to your browser, or through the
operating system directly (already starting to toss cross-platform
compatibility to the wind).</li>
</ol>
<p>These last three steps - <em>they</em> are the interesting ones. They&#39;re the start
of how we could get a &quot;DRM standard&quot; that can be implemented by <em>all</em>, not
just those platforms chosen by Microsoft, Adobe, or your friendly local
content provider. Here&#39;s how you explain EME&#39;s detail of such steps:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fNmDoFS.jpg" alt="Then a miracle occurs." title="Then a miracle occurs."></p>
<p><em>That&#39;s</em> why it&#39;s not a standard about DRM. There&#39;s no actual standardization
of DRM to be seen. If anyone still has <em>any</em> doubts that this then still
invokes &#39;DRM by plugin&#39;, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/100132233764003563318/posts/6QW8TLtV6q3" title="Google+ Widevine Content Decryption Module">here&#39;s a convenient Google+ post</a> by
Fran√ßois Beaufort, on his former company&#39;s CDM that Google acquired
to implement EME with Netflix.</p>
<p>Take a look at the &#39;type&#39; of Module it is in the post&#39;s picture: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAPI#PPAPI" title="NPAPI #PPAPI">PPAPI</a>.
This is the same plugin API, initially implemented by Chromium, that
Adobe is now uses for Flash player. Also that which Mozilla declined,
meaning Firefox is no longer able to run the latest version
of Flash on Linux. Google&#39;s CDM is therefore using the same plugin protocol
on Linux which has caused a major part of the anger and movement away from
Flash in the first place. Pluginless, cross-platform  DRM is clearly
an absolute fallacy.</p>

<p>Ok, sure. <em>Where</em> do you want your Netflix?</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows or Mac? <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" title="Get Silverlight 5">You&#39;ve already got it</a>. This is just

<li>iOS? <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8" title="Netflix on iTunes">Yep, still there</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>This isn&#39;t helping the web out either. Forgive me for asking, but why
exactly do you want swap out a native app experience for playing media
in your browser? Is that really an improved experience? In addition to
helping close down web standards and making a usable browser implementation
even harder to craft and ship, the different browser vendors (both mobile
and desktop) still have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out how to include proprietary bits of code (CDMs) from multiple
different content providers or middlemen</li>
<li>Negotiate and implement API with those providers</li>
<li>Hope those CDMs will be built for the platform(s) they want to support.</li>
</ul>
<p>How these CDMs would be bundled or distributed to everyone is
also a completely open question. I wish Mozilla all the best of luck if they
want to achieve all this openly and transparently. Are CDM providers going to
want to integrate with small software and hardware startups? <em>&quot;Well, do they
already have a large enough userbase to make the integration worthwhile?&quot;</em> is
what I can hear them asking.
Maybe, if there were a standard for all this...</p>
<h2><a name="it-s-open-or-closed-"class="anchor" href="#it-s-open-or-closed-"><span class="header-link"></span></a>It&#39;s open or closed.</h2>
<p>There&#39;s a good reason that open standards like TCP, HTTP, HTML, XML, JSON, AES
and many others, are all wildly successful and have defined
much of modern computing. Anyone can communicate using them, anyone can
implement them, and anyone can consume them. Not only that, but
<em>any one implementation should work with any other</em>. A Cisco router
can interpret a Broadcom NIC. A Microsoft browser can decode Node.js JSON
responses. Practically everything can parse valid XML.
HTML is the universal language of the web - renderable by everyone (well,
except for those <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <a href="http://xiphmont.livejournal.com/61927.html" title="Comments on Cisco, Mozilla and H.264"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code> codec</a> fights...). That is the
point of open standards - everyone can use them to communicate with everyone,
no matter who wrote the code.</p>
<p>EME is a standard that when implemented, can only be assumed to be operable
with one CDM implementation, on one browser, on one platform. It explicitly
allows for <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> to be broken for arbitrary users, no
matter what codecs they use. Remember when the web was going to &#39;just
work&#39; <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/flash-is-dead-long-live-html5/1633" title="ZDNet - Flash is dead. Long live HTML5">no matter what plugins you were missing</a>? Apparently
not a great idea anymore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/" title="Introducing the new Chromebook">ChromeOS</a> Laptops already use it - but if you want to get technical, you
should be a lot more specific than that. You can view Netflix on your laptop
<em>if</em> you&#39;re using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module" title="Trusted Platform Module">TPM</a> module, <em>if</em> your hardware is running the commercial
ChromeOS distribution, <em>if</em> you&#39;re in the Chrome browser (not <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home" title="The Chromium Projects">Chromium</a>),
and <em>if</em> you&#39;re using Google&#39;s CDM. Otherwise I&#39;m sure a whole lot 
of code signatures won&#39;t match and therefore you can&#39;t be
trusted to watch House of Cards.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t even begun to touch on what implementing this standard means for 
the viability of open platforms and software to continue be useful to the average
user in the future. Open source software has been pushing technology forwards
at an alarming pace, and the EME draft implements technology opposed to that.
It&#39;s saddening that open distributions like Debian won&#39;t be able to
take part in helping their users play the very media that Debian servers
are distributing. All take and no give may seem like the status quo these days,
but it is not in the spirit of the web.</p>
<h2><a name="don-t-forget-the-cookie-monster-"class="anchor" href="#don-t-forget-the-cookie-monster-"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Don&#39;t forget the cookie monster!</h2>
<p>There is one last juicy bit of detail that surprisingly, the Draft&#39;s authors
themselves <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-encrypted-media-20131022/#privacy-tracking" title="Encrypted Media Extensions - 8.2 Tracking">bring up</a> - another method of unavoidably tracking
users. Keys aren&#39;t the only thing EME is designed to negotiate - user licenses
for content are also included. The protocol allows for the browser to
communicate both ways: not only ask a server for a key, but also allow the CDM
to transmit back a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-encrypted-media-20131022/#session-id" title="Encrypted Media Extensions - 1.2.4 Session ID">session id</a>. This makes sense in context as you want to
be able to track a user&#39;s license to content, but it&#39;s also easily implemented
as another variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object" title="Local Shared Objects">Local Shared Objects</a> (flash cookies). I wouldn&#39;t
bank on CDMs making sessions easily accessible, manageable or removeable for
the user, though - after all, these could effectively be single-user licenses:
accessible means shareable. If nothing else, I hope the W3C doesn&#39;t implement
yet another way for companies to track browsing habits with this draft.
At the very least it shows some direct pitfalls of writing black
boxes into your specification.</p>
<h2><a name="tl-dr"class="anchor" href="#tl-dr"><span class="header-link"></span></a>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is absolutely no doubt that HTML EME is <em>still</em> well and truly
<strong>DRM by plugin</strong>. The module ChromeOS uses even runs on the same plugin
API that Flash does.</li>
<li>EME is a standard about key management, not DRM - it doesn&#39;t help
improve compatibility among browser implementations, but I don&#39;t know
why anyone would ever hope it could.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/" title="W3C Tracking Protection Working Group">Ironically</a>, this is a standard by W3C that specifies methods for
still more surreptitious user-tracking.
Though given its nature, this is hardly surprising.</li>
